# Certification Flash Cards

A web-based flash card application for studying for various IT certifications. The application allows you to test your knowledge of certification concepts through interactive flash cards. Currently supports AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server or internet connection required (runs entirely in the browser)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser

That's it! No build process, server, or installation required.

## How I made this.

This was all made with Cursor and Claude 3.5/3.7 agents. The only human written code was code to add new flash cards. Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's How I use LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw) and [Claudio Lassala's Breaking the Code Barrier: My First True No-Code AI Experience](https://lassala.net/2025/03/06/breaking-the-code-barrier-my-first-true-no-code-ai-experience/). 

Here are the prompts I used:

### Prompt 1

Initial prompt from an empty project.

```
Create a flash card app for studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. It should be runnable in local browser and will read data from flashcards.json. The look and feel of the web page should be familiar to a power user of AWS. All work will be done in this directory.
Acceptance criteria:
- Flash cards are ready from flashcards.json. This is how flashcards will be removed, added, and editted for the app.
- The cards should be shuffled between each play through.
- The user sees the front of the card initially, then sees the back of the card when they want to reveal it.
- The user should be able to track how many they got correct.
Scenarios:
Scenario 1: User starts a study session.
When the user opens the webpage, the flashcards should be loaded from flashcards.json.
Initially, the user does not see any flashcards, but they are invited to start a study session.
Scenario 2: Start a study session.
When the user starts a study session the flashcards are shuffled and the user is shown the front of the first card.
The user can choose to reveal the back of the card, go to the next card, or go to the previous card, or restart.
Scenario 3: Recording progress.
The user can indicate if they guessed correctly or not when they see the back of the card.
They should be able to see how many they guessed right out of the total cards in the deck.
Scenario 4: Restarting session.
If the user decided to restart, then cards are shuffled and they start from the beginning of the deck.
Progress is reset.
Scenario 5: Shuffling the deck.
When the deck is shuffled, it does not edit flashcards.json. Shuffling should be done in memory only.
Scenario 6: Finishing session.
When the user has finished a session, they are shown their progress and given the option to restart.
```

Everything generally worked pretty well.

### Prompt 2

I decided to make it support more than 1 certification type.

```
Make a change to the flash card app such that it can support more than 1 certification. Users will be able to study for AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam or the Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka exam. AWS flashcards are in aws-flashcards.json and CCDAK flashcards are in ccdak-flashcards.json. 
Acceptance criteria:
- Users should be able to do a study session with either AWS or CCDAK, not both.
- The look and feel should not change.
- The workflow of a study session should not change.
- How the app is launched should not change.
Scenarios:
Scenario 1: User opens the page.
When the user opens the webpage, they will have the choice between AWS study session or CCDAK study session. They have to pick one.
Scenario 2: User picks a study session.
When the user selects a study session, the flash card app should work exactly as it did before this change.
Scenario 3: Switching study sessions.
There should be a button in the top left corner to go back to the study session select screen.
This wipes out all progress.
```

The result was a bit clunky but overall worked.

### Prompt 3

I was not happy with the layout and styling.

```
We are going to change the look and feel of this app. Currently it is styled in a way that is familiar to AWS. We will change this and it will affect all parts of the app so everything has the same look at feel.
Acceptance criteria:
- The application will be named Certification Flash Cards.
- Color scheme should be one that supports concentation, memory retention, and reduce eye strain.
- There shoul be a comfortable contract between text and background.
- Light mode and dark mode options available.
- It should be reminiscent of a college library.
Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Color mode
There should be a light mode and dark mode that the user can toggle between. 
Both modes adhere to acceptance criteria.
```

The result of this was very buggy. I had to go back and forth with Claude about a dozen times to fix bugs. I fixed one at a time. Not all prompts are listed here but you get the idea.
